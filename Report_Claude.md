## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Shuffle Button Display Issue**
**Problem**: Two shuffle buttons were showing the same icon, causing confusion  
**Solution**: 
- Changed repeat mode OFF state from "üîÑ" to "‚û°Ô∏è" 
- Differentiated shuffle (üîÑ/üîÄ) from repeat (‚û°Ô∏è/üîÇ/üîÅ) buttons
- Maintained clear visual distinction between different modes

**Files Modified**: `NowPlayingScreen.kt`

### 2. **Song Title Display Issue**
**Problem**: Song titles were showing multiple lines instead of single line with ellipsis  
**Solution**: 
- Changed `maxLines = 2` to `maxLines = 1` in Now Playing screen
- Ensured long titles are truncated with "..." automatically
- Improved visual consistency across the app

**Files Modified**: `NowPlayingScreen.kt`

### 3. **Redundant Repeat Button**
**Problem**: User wanted only shuffle functionality, not repeat controls  
**Solution**: 
- Removed the repeat button from Now Playing screen
- Kept only shuffle/normal mode toggle
- Centered the single button for better visual balance

**Files Modified**: `NowPlayingScreen.kt`

### 4. **Button Size Issues**
**Problem**: Control buttons were too large and overwhelming  
**Solution**: 
- Reduced album art from 280dp to 220dp
- Adjusted button sizes: Previous/Next (72dp), Play/Pause (80dp)
- Updated typography from displayMedium/displayLarge to more reasonable sizes
- Reduced elevation values for better proportions

**Files Modified**: `NowPlayingScreen.kt`

### 5. **Playlist Creation Date Display**
**Problem**: "Created ..." text was cluttering playlist display  
**Solution**: 
- Removed the creation date text from playlist cards
- Simplified playlist display to show only names
- Cleaner, more focused UI

**Files Modified**: `PlaylistsScreen.kt`

### 6. **Broken Playlist Detail Screen**
**Problem**: Clicking playlists only showed ID numbers instead of actual content  
**Solution**: 
- Completely rewrote `PlaylistDetailScreen` from placeholder to full implementation
- Added proper ViewModel integration with `PlaylistDetailViewModel`
- Implemented song display, play functionality, and management features

**Files Modified**: `PlaylistsScreen.kt`, `ViewModelFactory.kt`

### 7. **Non-functional Long Press**
**Problem**: Long press to add songs to playlists wasn't working  
**Solution**: 
- Updated `SongRow` component to use `combinedClickable` instead of `clickable`
- Added proper long press detection with `onLongClick` callback
- Added `@OptIn(ExperimentalFoundationApi::class)` for API compatibility

**Files Modified**: `SongRow.kt`

### 8. **Multi-Select Mode Exit Issue**
**Problem**: No way to exit multi-select mode once entered  
**Solution**: 
- Added close button (‚úï) to selection mode top bar
- Reorganized selection mode UI layout
- Added `exitSelectionMode()` functionality call

**Files Modified**: `AllMusicScreen.kt`

### 9. **Icon Deprecation Warnings**
**Problem**: Build warnings about deprecated ArrowBack icons  
**Solution**: 
- Updated imports from `Icons.Default.ArrowBack` to `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.ArrowBack`
- Fixed deprecation warnings in multiple screens
- Improved code maintainability

**Files Modified**: `NowPlayingScreen.kt`, `PlaylistsScreen.kt`
